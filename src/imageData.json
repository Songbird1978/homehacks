        "info": "Flow temperature is the temperature of the water that your boiler sends to radiators. Reducing flow temperature is not the same as lowering your thermostat and will not noticeably reduce the temperature of your home but may increase the time it takes to reach the target temperature on your thermostat. If you are over 65, or have pre-existing health conditions, you may want to set a slightly higher flow temperature of 65°C to ensure your home warms more quickly.",

        "info": "When youre not using rooms, turn radiator valves down to between 2.5 and 3 (roughly 18°C). While you are using a room, increase the temperature to a comfortable level by turning the valve up. Turning off radiators completely in rooms you are not using is less energy efficient as this means your boiler has to work harder to increase the temperature again than if kept at a low setting. People over 65, children under 5 and those with pre-existing health conditions are more vulnerable to cold temperatures. Make sure you are warm enough and have a minimum indoor temperature of 18°C to ensure you protect your health while maintaining comfort.",
